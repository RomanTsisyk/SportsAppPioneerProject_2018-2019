As a co-developer of Smart Sport Apps, I'm sharing this code as an example of our work. The app has been in a frozen state since late 2018 - early 2019. By pushing this out into the community, I hope to find interest from fellow developers or enthusiasts who might learn from or even rejuvenate the project.
